# Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE)

#### Large-scale evaluation method for white-matter connectomes.

LiFE is intended for:

* Evaluating the evidence supporting white-matter connectomes generated using [magnetic resonance diffusion imaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) and [computational tractography ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractography).

* Performing statistical inference on white-matter connectomes: Compare white-matter connectomes, show the evidence for white-matter tracts and connections between brain areas.

##### LiFE is based on [MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) and requires [vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft). 
##### Installation
1. Download [LiFE](https://github.com/vistalab/life).
2. Download [vistasoft](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft).
3. [Start MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/startup-and-shutdown.html).
4. Add LiFE and vistasoft to the [matlab search path](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/addpath.html).
